# Retail-Line-Analysis

#Description

In this project, we explore a retail sales dataset and generate various analytics and insights from customers' past purchase behaviour. We go from analysing sales revenue to creating a customer segmentation analysis using the RFM technique. We go from basic SQL queries to exploring complex problems using SUB QUERY, CTEs, AGGREGATE, and WINDOW functions.
